# AI-Powered Citation Tracking for GitHub Copilot

This guide explains how to implement and use the AI citation tracking system when working with GitHub Copilot. Proper citation tracking ensures that you give appropriate credit to sources when generating code or documents. The system supports both Python and C# projects.

## Why Track Citations in AI-Generated Content?

When using AI tools like GitHub Copilot to assist with code generation, the AI might base its suggestions on existing code from various sources, including:

1. Open-source libraries and frameworks
2. Documentation examples
3. Stack Overflow answers
4. GitHub repositories
5. Academic papers and tutorials

Properly tracking these sources is important for:

- **Legal compliance** with licensing requirements
- **Ethical transparency** about the origins of code
- **Acknowledging contributions** from the community
- **Enabling verification** of implementation details
- **Building trust** in your development process

## Getting Started with Citation Tracking

### 1. Install the Citation Tracker

Add the `citation_tracker.py` module to your project:

```bash
# Download the citation_tracker.py file
curl -o citation_tracker.py https://your-repository-url/citation_tracker.py
```

Or copy it from this repository.

### 2. Initialize the Tracker in Your Project

```python
from citation_tracker import CitationTracker

# Initialize with your project path
tracker = CitationTracker()
```

### 3. Workflow: Using Copilot with Citations

#### Step 1: Ask Copilot a Question

When asking Copilot to generate code, be specific about what you're looking for:

```
@Copilot: Help me implement a function to parse OAuth tokens from an Amazon API response
```

#### Step 2: Review and Accept Generated Code

Review the code Copilot generates, make necessary adjustments, and then accept it.

#### Step 3: Add Citation Information

Immediately after accepting code from Copilot, add citation information:

```python
# Add the source
tracker.add_source(
    source_id="amazon-oauth-docs",
    name="Amazon OAuth Implementation Guide",
    url="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html",
    author="Amazon Developer Documentation",
    license_type="Amazon Developer Terms",
    description="Implementation pattern for OAuth token parsing"
)

# Cite the source in your file
tracker.cite_in_file(
    file_path="auth_utils.py",
    source_ids=["amazon-oauth-docs"],
    line_start=45,  # Starting line of the relevant code
    line_end=60,    # Ending line of the relevant code
    comment="Token parsing logic adapted from Amazon documentation"
)
```

#### Step 4: Add Attribution Headers

For files with significant external contributions:

```python
# Generate an attribution header
header = tracker.insert_attribution_header("auth_utils.py")

# Manually insert at the top of the file
# Or use an editor extension to do this automatically
```

#### Step 5: Generate Citations Document

Before sharing or publishing your code:

```python
# Generate a markdown file with all citations
tracker.export_citations_markdown()
```

## Automating Citation Tracking

### Using GitHub Actions

Add the `.github/workflows/update_citations.yml` file to your repository to automatically update the CITATIONS.md document on each push.

### Using VS Code Extension

The conceptual VS Code extension (to be implemented) would provide:

1. Commands to quickly insert citations
2. A sidebar to view all citations in the workspace
3. Hover information over citation markers
4. Automatic updating of the citations document

## Best Practices for AI Citation

1. **Cite Promptly**: Add citations immediately after adding AI-generated code
2. **Be Specific**: Include exact line numbers and clear descriptions
3. **Include License Information**: Always note the license type when available
4. **Link to Original Sources**: Provide URLs to the original documentation or code
5. **Update When Changing**: When modifying AI-generated code significantly, update the citation
6. **Review Before Publishing**: Always check CITATIONS.md before making code public

## Citation Format Examples

### For Algorithms and Patterns

```python
tracker.add_source(
    source_id="quick-sort-algorithm",
    name="QuickSort Implementation",
    author="GeeksforGeeks",
    url="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/",
    license_type="CC BY-SA",
    description="Efficient implementation of QuickSort algorithm"
)
```

### For API Integration Patterns

```python
tracker.add_source(
    source_id="twitter-api-oauth",
    name="Twitter API OAuth Flow",
    url="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a",
    author="Twitter Developer Documentation",
    license_type="Developer Agreement",
    description="OAuth 1.0a implementation pattern for Twitter API"
)
```

### For UI Components

```python
tracker.add_source(
    source_id="material-ui-datepicker",
    name="Material-UI DatePicker Component",
    url="https://material-ui.com/components/date-picker/",
    author="Material-UI Contributors",
    license_type="MIT",
    description="Implementation pattern for date picker component"
)
```

## Implementation for C# Projects

If you're working with C# projects, you can use our dedicated C# citation tracking implementation.

### 1. Install via NuGet Package

```bash
Install-Package CitationTracker
```

Or add it via the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

### 2. Initialize the Tracker in Your Project

```csharp
using CitationTracking;

// Initialize with your project path
var tracker = new CitationTracker();
```

### 3. Workflow: Using Copilot with Citations in C#

#### Step 1: Ask Copilot a Question

When asking Copilot to generate C# code, be specific about what you're looking for:

```
@Copilot: Help me implement a method to handle JWT token validation
```

#### Step 2: Review and Accept Generated Code

Review the code Copilot generates, make necessary adjustments, and then accept it.

#### Step 3: Add Citation Information

Immediately after accepting code from Copilot, add citation information:

```csharp
// Add the source
tracker.AddSource(
    sourceId: "ms-identity-web",
    name: "Microsoft Identity Web Authentication Library",
    url: "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/",
    author: "Microsoft Identity Team",
    licenseType: "MIT",
    description: "JWT token validation implementation pattern"
);

// Cite the source in your file
tracker.CiteInFile(
    filePath: "Services/AuthService.cs",
    sourceId: "ms-identity-web",
    lineStart: 45,  // Starting line of the relevant code
    lineEnd: 60,    // Ending line of the relevant code
    comment: "Token validation logic adapted from Microsoft Identity documentation"
);
```

#### Step 4: Add Attribution Headers

For files with significant external contributions:

```csharp
// Generate an attribution header
string header = tracker.InsertAttributionHeader("Services/AuthService.cs");

// Manually insert at the top of the file
// Or use the Visual Studio extension to do this automatically
```

#### Step 5: Generate Citations Document

Before sharing or publishing your code:

```csharp
// Generate a markdown file with all citations
tracker.ExportCitationsMarkdown();
```

### 4. Visual Studio Integration

You can enhance your workflow by:

1. Using the Visual Studio extension (conceptual, to be implemented)
2. Setting up MSBuild integration to automatically update citations during build
3. Using Git hooks to ensure citations are updated before commits

### 5. MSBuild Integration

Add the following to your .csproj file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="CitationTracker" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>

<PropertyGroup>
  <UpdateCitations>true</UpdateCitations>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This will automatically update your CITATIONS.md file during build.

## Conclusion

By integrating these citation tracking practices into your workflow with GitHub Copilot, you ensure proper attribution for code sources, maintain licensing compliance, and create a transparent record of how AI assisted in your development process.

Remember that citation tracking is not just about legal complianceâ€”it's about responsible use of AI and respect for the broader developer community whose work and knowledge have contributed to the AI's capabilities.
